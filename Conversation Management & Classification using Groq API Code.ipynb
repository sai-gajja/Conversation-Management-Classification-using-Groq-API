      "User: We are 4 friends planning for 5 days. What's the best way to travel from Delhi?\n",
      "Assistant: For a 5-day trip to Goa from Delhi, you have several options to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Flights**: The fastest way to reach Goa from Delhi is by flying. There are numerous flights available from Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) to Dabolim Airport (GOI) in Goa. Flight duration is about 1.5 hours, and prices vary depending on the airline, time of booking, and demand. You can check with airlines like Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Vistara for the best deals.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Trains**: Another option is to take a train from Delhi to Goa. The train journey takes around 36-40 hours, depending on the route and type of train. You can book tickets with Indian Railways or private operators like Goa Express and Netravati Express.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering your time constraint, I would recommend taking a flight to Goa. You can book your flights in advance to get the best deals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you arrive in Goa, you can rent a taxi or book a hotel that offers airport transfers to get to your destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's move on to the next step – choosing the best time to visit Goa. Since you're planning to visit next month, the weather should be pleasant, but it's always a good idea to be prepared for any unexpected weather conditions.\n",
      "\n",
